chapter 2 summary...


--let var and const

--let and var are used when we want variables to change values anywhere within
 the program(difference between them is that let has block scope, while var
      has a global scope)

 --so if a variable is declared with let in a function for example..it wont be
     used outside the encapsulating brackets of that function.. 

--const is used to keep values constant...

//**exercise 2.3**//
--1) we use the prompt to get two values(a,b)
--2)then we use Number() method to convert the string values to numbers
--3)then we had to square the values and then add them up, afterward i used 
    the sqrt() method to find the square root it self...
