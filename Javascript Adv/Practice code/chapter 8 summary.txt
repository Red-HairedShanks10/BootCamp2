//***Exercise 8.5**//
we had to replace vowels with numbers 

1)created the variable for the original string to be replaced
  --we also had to convert it to lowercase

2)created an array for the vowels

3)used the foreach() method to loop through vowel letters...
 --an displayed the letter which will be converted in each iteration

4)we had to use the string method replaceALL()
to replace all occurrences of that letter in the OG string
with the index of the vowel in the array...

5)we had to display the new string...

//*******///



//**Projects***//

1)we had to create a string variable 

2)created a function that would take the str value....

3)created variable to hold the length of the str value
  --we use this to set the maximum number iterations for this loop

4)we had to create the temporary string to hold the scrambled
 world...

5)using the for loop to iterate through the letters of the
 parameter value...

6)created the index variable to hold the randomly select letter's
 index

7)we then add the letter using its index to the temp string

8)as the loop continues, display the temp string...

9)this part is from the textbook answers...this allows us to update
original string val, as the letters are transfered to the temporary
 string...

10)we return the final scramble string
