chapter 6 summary......

--functions are important for the reuse of lines of code

--we learnt new things about functions in this chapter such as:

--recursive functions
--arrow functions
--understanding the scope of variables when we declare them within functions...

--using the IIFE(immidiately invoked function expression)to make a function execute as soon as it is made....


**Exercise 6.5***

1)create a variable assigned with string value...

2)we use this function to see which variable(with the same name) but different  value will be prioritised
by the function...which is always the local variable

3)
a)assign the function to a variable called result
b)within the function, gave the str_var a new value
c)used return keyword to make sure the value will be returned
d)displaye the result variable and the str_var to see what the values are..


4)create an anonymus function:
a)gave it a parameter
b)display a sentence that includes the param value
c)passed a value...

d)used the arrow format of an IIFE as well....


*****END OF Exercise 6.5*********

**Project 1...make a recursive function**

--function that counts up to 10
a)using the if statement to make sure that the function is invoked 10 times
b)add 1 to the param value as the function is recalled
c)passed in a param value
