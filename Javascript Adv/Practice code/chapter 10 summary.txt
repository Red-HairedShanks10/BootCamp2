chapter 10 summary


//**Projects**//

**Collapsible and Expandible accordian**

1)we had to use queryselectorAll(), method to select all elements
   with a class of title... and stored them into a variable (title)

2)we do the same thing for the elements with a class of myText

3)since these variables hold multiple elements, these variables store
  the elements in an array format...
  a)now we get to use the foreach to iterate through the variable
    "title" 
  b) so we can add event listeners to make sure that when the
      title elements get clicked on, it will look for the nearest
      element siblings and allows the user to show or hide content
       in the element siblings..

   c) we call the remover() function that we  had to make in order
      to remove the class of "active" from elements once they are
      clicked on...
