**Manipulating HTML elements

--we were given HTML code which we were suppose to manipulate...

**Inside the script tag **

1) we had to select the element with output class..

2)we had to create an object that would hold the element within 
  the output elemnt
  b)then updated the the ul tag id to "mainList"
   --the we displayed the mainList in the console...
  

3)we had to search for elements with the div tag and display them
  in console as an array...

4)using the for loop
a)we set the id of each div tag to "id" with a number 

b)we then alternate color of each div's content to red or blue
--if the division of i by 2 retruns a remainder then make it red
--if not(or returns a 0) then make the content blue...

--we have three div elements so set in an array format...
