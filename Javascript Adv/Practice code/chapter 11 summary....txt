chapter 11 summary...

Im this chapter:
we learnt different ways to specify events, then we focused
 on different event handlers in more depth which allowed for
different types of interactions with the user...

//exercise 11.1//

1)we set the dark mode to false...

2)we use the window.onclick to create a function, which will
 be called when the page is clicked on...

3)in this function, we check if the darkmode is set to true or
  false
 
 a)if false we set the background to black and font to white...

  b)if not set it the background to white and font black..

1-2)creating objects to hold the elements with these classes

3)in this foreach loop
--we had to iterate through the stars object, so we can add a
  a value of 1 to the index of each start element...

--we also add an eventlistener on to call on the starRate() funct
  when theres a click on each star...

4)
--in the starRate function, we had to display the value of the stars
  given by the user..
   
5)
we iterate through the star elements again, to add the class of
 orange to the class list, otherwise remove the class of orange...
