**creating a multipication table

1)we had to make an empty array

2)we had to specify how many elements we want to multiply with each other
(since we are dealing with arrays)

3)we had to use an outer for-loop to iterate over each row...

a)also had to create a temporary array(temp)


4)then used an inner for-loop to add the multiplied values to the temporary 
 array, (x iteration represents current row value , while y iteration represents current column value)

5)
we had to add all the (temp[]) array values to the main array(proj_table)
