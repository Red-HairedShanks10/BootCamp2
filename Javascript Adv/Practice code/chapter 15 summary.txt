--**Working with JSON***--

1)created a json file named people.json

2-3)in this json file we had to create an array that stores objects
 with the same property names (first,last,topic)

4)in the JS file, 
--a)we use the people.json file as URL
 
--b)we use fetch to connect the URL 

--c)we use the .json() method to format the response data into JSON
   format thats because we are dealing with a JSON file in the first
   place..

5)we console log the data

6)using the foreach() we iterate through the objects in the data and
 display it in the console
