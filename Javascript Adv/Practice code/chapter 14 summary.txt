chapter 14 summary

1) we create a canvas element and canvas context which we will use
   to draw.....

2)we set the attribute height and weight of the canvas, then we 
 prepend the canvas to the body of the page...

3)we had to create an array colval..
--a)we used a for loop to add a number of items with the value of 0
     to get the number of items we divide the width by 10


4)we had to create a matrix function to run at 50 millisec intervals

//**in the function**//
5)In the function, we set the the fillStyle to be black, and gave it
  an opacity of .05 which gives us a fading effect

6)we set the canvas font color green

7)we had to use the array Map, to iterate thru all the items to
 colval array

--8/a)we use Math.random() to alternate between 0 or 1,
   to make sure that the values is 0 or 1, we make a condition
   that checks if the Math.random value is less than 0.5....

--9/b)we set position X by multiplying the index value by 10

--10/c)we use the ctx filltext() method to display "output" value
      on the specified x and y axis

--11/d)we check if posY is greater than 100 plus a random number 
      between 0-300, then set colval index to 0

--12/e)but if posY is less, then increment colval index at posY by 10
