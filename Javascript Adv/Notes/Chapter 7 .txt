//*****Classes****//

This chapter we learn about Javascript classes...

--with classes, they are essentially blueprints for the creation of objects..

--Classes enable OOP

we will learn :

1)what classes are?
2)how we can create them?
3) how we use?


we will also learn about:
*OOP
* Classes and Objects
* Inheritance
* Prototypes



**OOP**
OOP is important in that code structured in objects(what does that mean?),
which leads to easier to maintain and reusable code...we it helps us think of
all sorts of topics in objects(for example?)...

********

**Classes and Objects**
--Objects are a collection of properties and methods...

syntax of objects:

 let dog = { dogName: "JavaScript",
     weight: 2.4,
     color: "brown",
     breed: "chihuahua"
  };


--classes in JS can encapsulate data and functions built for those classes

syntax for an object blue print class:

 1) class ClassName {
   2) constructor(prop1, prop2) {//constructor with two parameters
   this.prop1 = prop1;//class properties sharing the same name as the param
   this.prop2 = prop2;
  }
}

//we create an instance of an object here 
let obj = new ClassName("arg1", "arg2");

at 1) we declare the class and give it a name of 'Classname'
2)we  have a constructor which will initialise the properties(prop1,prop2)(what is a constructor exactly? properties for the new instance or every instance?)

--properties of a class are identified by the "this" keyword
