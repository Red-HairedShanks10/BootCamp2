Lesson8 summary


//**Code**//

8.1***

1)
--a)we include the express module
--b)we create an instance of the express server and store it in app
--c)we also include our homeController...


2)
--a)we use the express get() which takes in a route argument and callback function
    with req and res object parameters, each with a set of properties we can use
    give the correct response to the type of request made...

--b)we use send() that works like the write() from http module, but i think here
    we dont use end() after giving a response maybe send() does it automatically...
