Lesson4 summary****
we learn about:

1)creating a basic web server with npm
2)making code that processes requests and returninf response
3)running web server in our browsers....

///**Main.js--Code***////
--1)we start of with requiring the http and status-codes modules...

--2)we then use the http.createServer() method to create a Server
    instance and we store the server in the app variable....
   
--a)we then setup the app to receive HTTP requests and send HTTP
     responses

 --b)we then use httpStatus.OK to use a response code(200) that indicates
     that there were no problems in returning the http response header
     which is in the form of an HTML content type....

--c)we assign the local variable responseMessage with a response in HTML
   --we then close the response with res.end(), in order to indicate that
     we are no longer writing content...

--d)we then use the listen() to indicate that the server is awaiting for
   requests at port 3000
