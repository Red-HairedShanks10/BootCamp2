******Creating a Nodejs module***********

A nodejs application can consists of many different javascript files,
reasonn behind this, is focused on effeciency and to maintain 
effeciency of any node.js application we need to make sure that
these files access each other's code....

**???(1)***
a)How do we make these files access each other?

***///***


///******///
--to make a javascript file's content accessible we use the
  exports key word to add the variables,functions, arrays etc
  as properties of the exports object...

--we can then import the readily accessible content in another javascript file using the require() method to target the file
and assign it to a constant object 

example of require:
   
 //here we create a constant that holds all the objects(variable,
   functions, arrays etc)
   const numbersModule = require("./numbers.js");
 
  //here we then use dot notation to access the properties
  a)numbersModule.num_arr.foreach(n => console.log(n));
 b)numbersModule.addNum(3,4);

--the require method belongs to the global Module object...

///******///

///**Running NPM***//

NPM--is a Nodejs package manager, which helps with managing external packages(these are external modules built by other developers and made available online)

using npm in command prompt we can install, remove and modify external packages...

--npm init

--npm install/i (package name) -save/-s or you could have the 
  (--global/-g) flag
