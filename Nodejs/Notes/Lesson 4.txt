in this lesson we learn about:

--generating a basic web server using Node.js and npm

--writing code that handles requests from a browser and returns a
  response

--running a web server in a browser

****???******
So what is a web server?
****////******
A web serveris software that responds to requests over the internet
by loading and/or processing data, web servers use HTTP which is 
a system for the viewing of web pages and sending data over the 
internet...
*************

--A client(our computer) and server can interact with each other
 through HTTP verbs.what that means is that these verbs will 
 determine the type of request being made(e.g if a user is trying to
 load a new web page)

**HTTP methods mostly used:

//*GET()**//
--this method requests info from the server,and the response from the
  server usually is content that can be view from the web browser(e.g
  clicking on a link that sends the user to the home page of a site)

//**//

//**POST()**//
--this method sends info to a server,the response from the server maybe
  with a redirection to another web page, after processing the needed
   data (e.g submitting a sign-up or sign-in form)
