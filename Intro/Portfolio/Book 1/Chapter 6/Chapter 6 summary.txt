Book 1 Chapter 6 summary

Conditionals and Loops:

In this chapter we learn that conditionals and loops are control structures that help with controlling when, where and how pieces of code 
are executed...

1) we can use if, else if and else statements to execute code if certain conditions are true...
 2) we also use loops to execute code as long as a condition is true, through while loops and or for loops
