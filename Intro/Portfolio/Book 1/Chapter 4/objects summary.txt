Book 1 chapter 4 summary 
Objects:


in this Chapter we learn that  Objects are similar to arrays in that they can store multiple data together
with the differences being that we can 

1) use objects to represent a single thing with multpile attributes, e.g an animal like dog and its many characteristic(legs,teeth,bark etc)
2) we access the data stored in an array with numbers(indexes) through square brackets[],
   --while in objects, we access elements inside an object with strings called keys/properties associated with that object
